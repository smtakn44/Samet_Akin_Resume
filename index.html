				<h2>Experience</h2>
				<h3>Artificial Intelligence Intern at TÜBİTAK Bilgem</h3>
				<p>Summer 2023</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
					Trained different CNN models (such as VGG16 and ResNet) for fruit classification with
					different parameters (learning rate, number of layers etc.)
					</li>
					<li>
					Examined model performances by following train and validation loss graphs
					</li>
					<li>
					Generated different backgrounds with DALL-E AI tool and combined with fruit photos by
					using Python OpenCV library, to have a syntethic dataset for fruit location detection.
					</li>
					<li>
					Performed object detection by using YOLOv5 and YOLOv8.

						<h2>Autonomous Car Team Project</h2>
						<p>
 						Worked for an autonomous car that adjust its speed according to the data from the traffic signs detected by the Esp32 camera.
						Experienced working in harmony and distribution of tasks with a team of 5 people.
						Took part in the image processing section of the project.
						Utilized YoloV5 and Python OpenCV library.
						Used supervised deeplearning.
						Composed a strong dataset consisted of over 500 traffic sign photos that taken from different angles and under varying light 							conditions.
						More than 500 photos were labeled one by one by using LabelImg.
						Trained data at high epoch value by using Google Colab.

						</p>

						<h2>Traffic Estimation with Deep Learning</h2>
						<p>
 						Preprocessed date and weather data (Scaling, label encoding etc.)
						Trained a deep learning regression model that estimate traffic density by examining effect of different
						activation functions, number of layers and neurons
